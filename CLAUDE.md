## Available Tools

### Scripts (run via Bash)

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `.claude/scripts/context-collector.sh` | Get current date, time, git status, system info | `bash .claude/scripts/context-collector.sh` |
| `.claude/scripts/init-project.sh` | Regenerate this CLAUDE.md | `bash .claude/scripts/init-project.sh --force` |

### Commands (invoke with /)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/create_requirement` | Create or discover requirements from codebase |
| `/create_plan` | Create detailed implementation plans |
| `/implement_plan` | Execute plans phase by phase |
| `/research_codebase` | Deep codebase research |
| `/commit` | Structured git commits |
| `/describe_pr` | Generate PR descriptions |
| `/debug` | Investigation-only debugging |
| `/context` | Display current system context |

### Agents (spawned automatically)

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `codebase-locator` | Find files by topic |
| `codebase-analyzer` | Understand implementations |
| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Find similar patterns |
| `quality-gate` | Run verification checks |
| `test-writer` | Write tests |
| `research-agent` | Research objectively |
| `status-reporter` | Generate reports with timestamps |

## Context Collection

Before generating reports or timestamps, run:
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/context-collector.sh
```

This provides accurate:
- Current date/time with timezone
- Git branch and uncommitted changes
- Tool versions
- Working directory

## Thoughts Directory

Store persistent metadata in `thoughts/`:
- `thoughts/shared/requirements/` - Feature specs, tickets, user stories
- `thoughts/shared/plans/` - Implementation plans (created from requirements)
- `thoughts/shared/research/` - Codebase research documents

### Workflow

1. **Requirements** → User creates or you help create specs in `requirements/`
2. **Planning** → `/create_plan requirements/ENG-1234.md` creates plan in `plans/`
3. **Research** → `/research_codebase topic` saves findings in `research/`
4. **Implementation** → `/implement_plan plans/2025-12-20-feature.md` executes plan

### File Naming

| Directory | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| requirements/ | `[ticket]-description.md` | `ENG-1234-auth-feature.md` |
| plans/ | `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` | `2025-12-20-auth-feature.md` |
| research/ | `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` | `2025-12-20-api-patterns.md` |

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Run tests before committing
- Never commit secrets or credentials

## Working Style

- **Planning**: Use `/create_plan` for non-trivial changes
- **Verification**: Run automated checks, pause for manual verification
- **Git**: Review changes before committing
