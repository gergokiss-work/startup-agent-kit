## Available Tools

### Scripts (run via Bash)

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `.claude/scripts/context-collector.sh` | Get current date, time, git status, system info | `bash .claude/scripts/context-collector.sh` |
| `.claude/scripts/init-project.sh` | Regenerate this CLAUDE.md | `bash .claude/scripts/init-project.sh --force` |

### Commands (invoke with /)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/create_requirement` | Create or discover requirements from codebase |
| `/create_plan` | Create detailed implementation plans |
| `/implement_plan` | Execute plans phase by phase |
| `/research_codebase` | Deep codebase research |
| `/commit` | Structured git commits |
| `/describe_pr` | Generate PR descriptions |
| `/debug` | Investigation-only debugging |
| `/context` | Display current system context |

### Agents (spawned automatically)

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `codebase-locator` | Find files by topic |
| `codebase-analyzer` | Understand implementations |
| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Find similar patterns |
| `quality-gate` | Run verification checks |
| `test-writer` | Write tests |
| `research-agent` | Research objectively |
| `status-reporter` | Generate reports with timestamps |

### Agent Templates

Create domain-specific expert agents using:
- `.claude/agents/templates/domain-expert-template.md` - Template for creating project-specific agents

## Context Collection

Before generating reports or timestamps, run:
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/context-collector.sh
```

This provides accurate:
- Current date/time with timezone
- Git branch and uncommitted changes
- Tool versions
- Working directory

## Directory Structure

### Thoughts Directory

Store persistent metadata in `thoughts/`:

| Directory | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `thoughts/shared/requirements/` | Feature specs, tickets, user stories | `ENG-1234-auth-feature.md` |
| `thoughts/shared/plans/` | Implementation plans | `2025-01-06-auth-feature.md` |
| `thoughts/shared/research/` | Codebase research documents | `2025-01-06-api-patterns.md` |
| `thoughts/shared/decisions/` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) | `2025-01-06-database-choice.md` |
| `thoughts/shared/blockers/` | Known issues and impediments | `2025-01-06-api-limitation.md` |

### Artifacts Directory

Store generated artifacts in `.claude/artifacts/`:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.claude/artifacts/reports/` | Gap analysis, audit reports |
| `.claude/artifacts/reviews/` | Code review documents |
| `.claude/artifacts/logs/` | Test and debug logs |

### Knowledge Directory

Store reference documentation in `.claude/knowledge/`:
- Architecture decisions
- Domain knowledge
- API documentation
- Compliance requirements

## Workflow

1. **Requirements** → Create specs in `requirements/`
2. **Planning** → `/create_plan requirements/ENG-1234.md` creates plan in `plans/`
3. **Research** → `/research_codebase topic` saves findings in `research/`
4. **Implementation** → `/implement_plan plans/2025-01-06-feature.md` executes plan

## Session Memory Protocol (Optional)

For projects requiring state persistence across sessions, see:
`.claude/templates/session-memory-protocol.md`

Enable for:
- Long-running projects with complex state
- Multi-session feature development
- Team handoffs requiring context preservation

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Run tests before committing
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Always leave empty line at end of file
- Trim trailing whitespace

## Working Style

- **Planning**: Use `/create_plan` for non-trivial changes
- **Verification**: Run automated checks, pause for manual verification
- **Git**: Review changes before committing
